#  I use every time: RADIO.


# Here’s how it works:

- **⚡ R – Requirements**
Start lean. Get crystal clear on functional + non-functional needs.
Don’t try to redesign Netflix in 35 minutes.

- **⚡ A – Architecture**
Cover protocols and trade-offs (WebSockets? Polling? SSE?).
Then walk through your component structure—state, props, and patterns.

- **⚡ D – Data Model**
Explain the data flow. What’s stored where? Cached, shared, computed?

- **⚡ I – APIs**
Define clean, minimal APIs. Focus on real-world practicality, not theory.

- **⚡ O – Optimizations**
This is where you stand out: bundle splitting, lazy loading, caching, virtualization, TTI, accessibility.
