üìÜ 8-Week Learning Roadmap: Mobile System Design for Android Developers
Each week focuses on a key theme with actionable deliverables.

‚úÖ Week 1: Foundations of System Design
Goal: Understand how modern systems work.

Topics:

What is system design?
Types of system design:
High-level (HLD) ‚Äì system architecture, communication
Low-level (LLD) ‚Äì class design, component interactions
Client-server architecture
APIs and protocols (REST, gRPC, WebSockets)
Client-server model
RESTful APIs, HTTP basics
Latency, throughput, scalability, availability
API rate limiting & retries

Deliverables:
Summarize a sample backend flow for your app (e.g., login, fetch data).

Diagram request/response lifecycle.
Mock Question:
Design a backend architecture to fetch and display a list of posts in a mobile app (like Instagram feed). Focus on response speed and pagination.


‚úÖ Week 2: Android App Architecture & Clean Code
Goal: Master app-level architecture for scalability.

Topics:
MVVM vs MVP vs MVI

Jetpack components: ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation

Clean Architecture (use-cases, repository, DI)

Resources:
‚ÄúGuide to App Architecture‚Äù (developer.android.com)

Videos by Philipp Lackner or Vasiliy Zukanov (YouTube)

Deliverables:
Refactor an old screen with Clean Arch

Apply dependency injection (Hilt/Koin)

Mock Question:
How would you structure a large Android project to support multiple product flavors (e.g., Uber Driver vs Rider)?

‚úÖ Week 3: Networking & APIs
Goal: Learn how mobile clients consume APIs efficiently.

Topics:
Retrofit, OkHttp internals

Caching strategies (etag, cache headers)

Offline support and retry strategies

Pagination strategies (cursor-based vs offset)

Deliverables:
Build a Retrofit API layer with caching and pagination

Mock Question:
Design a mobile client that shows 1000 products from a slow API. Minimize loading time and data usage.

‚úÖ Week 4: Data Storage & Offline Sync
Goal: Handle local storage, syncing, and conflicts.

Topics:
Room DB, DAO patterns

WorkManager for background sync

Offline-first principles

Data consistency & conflict resolution

Deliverables:
Build a note-taking app with offline support and sync on reconnect

Mock Question:
Design the local storage and sync strategy for Google Keep. How would you handle conflicts?

‚úÖ Week 5: Authentication & Security
Goal: Design secure authentication for mobile apps.

Topics:
OAuth2, JWT, token refresh

Biometric auth

Secure storage (Keystore, EncryptedSharedPrefs)

Certificate pinning

Deliverables:
Implement login flow with token refresh and secure storage

Mock Question:
How would you design a secure login and session management system for a banking app?

‚úÖ Week 6: Push Notifications & Messaging
Goal: Learn how mobile apps receive messages at scale.

Topics:
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

Topics, device groups

Background notification handling

Delivery guarantees (QoS, retries)

Deliverables:
Create a chat or notification module using FCM

Mock Question:
Design a scalable push notification system for a food delivery app. How do you prevent duplicate notifications?

‚úÖ Week 7: Scalable Mobile System Design
Goal: Apply HLD principles to mobile use cases.

Topics:
Load balancing, caching (CDN, Redis)

Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

Database scaling (sharding, replication)

Mobile-backend-specific design patterns

Deliverables:
Design HLD for a feature-rich mobile system (e.g., YouTube app)

Mock Questions:
Design the backend for uploading and streaming videos (like YouTube).

How would you handle billions of messages in a chat app with delivery guarantees?

‚úÖ Week 8: Observability, DevOps & Practice
Goal: Improve release, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

Topics:
CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bitrise, Gradle optimizations)

Firebase Performance, Sentry, Crashlytics

Play Store phased rollout, feature flags

A/B testing (Firebase Remote Config)

Deliverables:
Integrate crash reporting and performance monitoring into an app

Simulate a release pipeline

Mock Question:
How would you design a phased rollout system for a new feature in your app with 100 million users?
